### Dirtly Little .NET Hooker 

In this presentation, we will delve into the powerful capabilities of Frida, an open-source dynamic instrumentation toolkit. We will specifically focus on its application in hooking .NET applications from a red team perspective. Attendees will learn about the architecture of .NET applications and the challenges associated with reverse engineering and exploitation.

We will demonstrate how to set up Frida to manipulate .NET applications in real time, showcasing techniques for intercepting API calls, modifying application behavior, and extracting sensitive data. The presentation will cover practical use cases, including bypassing security measures, analyzing application flow, and uncovering vulnerabilities.
